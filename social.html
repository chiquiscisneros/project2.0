  <h2>Why domestic violence is a social justice issue.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When violent abuse comes from someone who has promised to love and protect you, it can be a terrifying shock. For some victims, this initially unexpected behavior is simply written off. It is seen as a one time thing. Once it starts to become a recurring problem, unfortunately, sometimes excuses are still made or those affected are fully aware of the issue, but feel as though they have nowhere else to go. As one survivor put it, being under the constant threat of  domestic violence makes one feel as though he or she is living life scrunched up in a box, their hopes, dreams, emotions, and opinions stuffed away and controlled by their abuser. The issue of domestic violence is prevalent in the U.S. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, nearly 20 people in the United States experience physical abuse from an intimate partner every minute. On an average day, domestic violence hotlines nationwide receive over 20,000 calls. One in three women and one in seven men have been victims of domestic violence in their lifetimes.</li>

  <h2>Objectives of social justice brief</h2>
    <li>The objectives of this social justice brief are to
have a comprehensive discussion about the
psychosocial implications of IPV for both the
survivors and our society. We also will examine
closely the at-risk factors for being a survivor
of IPV; strategies to preventing IPV; and
programs, services, legislation, and policies
for addressing the physical and psychological
aftermath of IPV. Perhaps of equal importance,
the brief will discuss the degree to which
children exposed to IPV suffer from early
childhood trauma and the resultant
manifestations of adverse behavior during
later developmental stages.

  <h2>Social Justice for the Victims</h2>
  <li> Social justice provides an overview of restoraticve justice as a process and examines its relevance to women who have been victimized by physical and sexual abuse/ The starting point is the justice system with its roots in adversial, offender-oriented practices of obtaining justice. The widespread dissatisfaction by battered woman and rape victims and their advocates with the current system of mandatory law enforcment opens the door for consideration of alternative forms of dealing with domestic violence. restortative justice strategies, as argued here, have several major advantages. Like social work, these strategies are solution-based rather than problem-base process, give voice to marginalized people, and focus on healing. Moreover, restorative justice offers an avenue through within the profession of social work can re-estabalish its historic role in criminal justice. The four models most relevant to women's victimization are victim-offender confrencing, family group confrencing, healing circles, and community reparations. Each model is examined seprately from a feminist standpoint. The discussion is informed by insights from the teachings of standpoint feminist theory and social work values, especially social justice.
